## Self-heaing ESP32 nostr-arduino based mesh network

There are various approaches to constructing mesh networks with microcontrollers, and one such method is the nostrmesh, which leverages WiFi connectivity between nodes and the nostr protocol.

While utilizing WiFi for node connections imposes a range limitation of less than 200 meters, it significantly boosts bandwidth, thereby enabling the sharing of internet access across the mesh network.

ESP32 microcontrollers are both highly affordable and widely accessible. With a mere $1 cost for the basic controller, nodes can be effortlessly integrated into passive electronics such as light bulbs, facilitating the creation of a robust mesh network.
